          Happy Anniversary, Honey <br>
          The past three years have been the happiest and fullest of my life. <br>
My world is a beautiful place because of you, because of the love that you’ve given me. <br>
Thank you for sharing with me your positive outlook on life. When I grow panicky and full of anxiety, you calm and soothe me. When I feel that things are bigger than I am, you are always there, holding my hand, showing me that together we can handle anything in our path. <br>
Thank you for the security that you offer me. Your stable, calm nature brings precious peace to my world. Few things feel better than falling at night, knowing that you are always there for me. <br>
 Thank you for your sense of humour.  So often, I grow focused on the bumps in the road. I love that you tell me jokes that are so long that it takes you years to get to the punchline, because by the time you’re done, I can’t remember what was even plaguing me in the first place. <br>
Thank you for remaining endlessly patient with me. I am indeed a work in progress. I appreciate your ability to look at me and know that although I am imperfect, my strengths outnumber my weaknesses. <br>
 Thank you for truly loving me unconditionally.  The knowledge that even when I stumble and fall, you are there to pick me up, brush me off, and hold me close, is undoubtedly one of the loveliest gifts ever given to me. <br>
Thank you for supporting me and pushing me further than I think I can possibly go. Thank  you for acknowledging that being a boyfriend is just a part of who I am and for encouraging me to be Varun, the aspiring CA student, the man, the individual. <br>
Can’t thank you enough for everything and literally can’t wait to be with you FOREVER <br>
I love you Baby
